Brooklyn Housing Market Project

To begin, our general project scope entailed analyzing a large dataset containing all property sales in the borough of Brooklyn
between the years of 2003 and 2017 with the purpose of defining which variables we believe have had the most impact on sale prices 
and will continue to do so. This dataset was available to us on Kaggle but originates from the NYC Department of Finance 
Annualized Sales files. With the dataset containing all commerical and residential property sales, we narrowed down the data to 
include sales associated with only one-family dwellings. 

The reasoning behind focusing on one-family dwellings was to enable us to answer the two following questions: Which variables 
would be deemed most important to a single family moving into Brooklyn and which of those have the most impact on the sale prices?

The filtered dataset included many details regarding every recorded one-family home sale in each neighborhood in Brooklyn such as
sale price, square footage, year built, school district, and much more. This dataset was obviously the main data component of this
project but in order to determine which school districts were more favorable than others, we used GreatSchools which enabled us to
pinpoint which districts and neighborhoods had higher ranked public school (schools ranked 8 or above out of 10). 

In summary, we were able to determine the key variables that we believe have meaningful impacts on the property sales. 
Additionally, we developed scores for the top districts based on housing affordability in the respective neighborhoods and the 
individual school rankings. With improvements, this dataset can be used for property sales predictive analyses possibly using
linear regression and/or other methods.
