Brooklyn Housing Market Project

To begin, our general project scope entailed analyzing a large dataset containing all property sales in the borough of Brooklyn between the years of 2003 and 2017 with the purpose of defining which variables we believe have had the most impact on sale prices and will continue to do so. This dataset was available to us on Kaggle but originates from the NYC Department of Finance Annualized Sales files. With the dataset containing all commerical and residential property sales, we narrowed down the data to include sales associated with only one-family dwellings. 

The reasoning behind focusing on one-family dwellings was to enable us to answer the two following questions: Which variables would be deemed most important to a single family moving into Brooklyn and which of those have the most impact on the sale prices? Using these questions, we formulated the hypothesis we intend on testing: Sale price, square footage and school district rankings are most important variables considered by young families when considering moving into a specific neighborhood in Brooklyn. Not only are these variables most important they all affect one another. 

The filtered dataset included many details regarding every recorded one-family home sale in each neighborhood in Brooklyn such as sale price, square footage, year built, school district, and much more. This dataset was obviously the main data component of this project but in order to determine which school districts were more favorable than others, we used GreatSchools which enabled us to pinpoint which districts and neighborhoods had higher ranked public school (schools ranked 8 or above out of 10).
